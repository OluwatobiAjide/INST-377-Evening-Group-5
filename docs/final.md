* Technical system decision rationale --
In this project, our preliminary decision is to use HTML and CSS for the website and to author the front end. We may use Javascript as our code for the project too.  Our target devices are computers and phones. We are using HTML for the basic structure of the project and using CSS for the style. CSS is used for formatting the website on different devices the screen will change based on their size. Javascript will be the main function of your design, we need to keep updating our website from then Open Data Prince George’s County website. We also need to store data into our database by using Node.js. We will also use Express Framework to handles all the interactions between the frontend and the database. And Leaflet, we will use it to Insert the map to the website. And all the code will be written in visual studio code
