# User Manual:

Our website's goal is to help people to find out the most safety restaurant in PG county. In our system, people can use zip code to search restaurants that they want to go within Prince Georgeâ€™s area. Then the result will tell them the safety level of the restaurants based on a three-level color rating. Or if they want to check a specific restaurant's safety level, they can also use the restaurant's address and name to search the result. The results will show down below the search bar. And there is a map next to the result section so that the user can confirm the location of the restaurant.

#### Instructions

2. In the same toggle you can pick between gettting the full result or safete level
