## Title: 
 Restaurant Rater
 ## Description of our project:
  
   Nowadays, more and more people concern about food safety. People who are concerned about food safety are unable to find the restaurant by scrolling down the dataset. It is important for people to have the satisfaction that they are eating in a sanitary environment and intaking food that is not contaminated. Therefore, our project goal is to help people to find out safety restaurants to go to eat. In our system, users can search Prince Georgeâ€™s Country's restaurants with zip code, restaurants' name, and restaurants' address, and our system will show users that restaurant's results, and inspection year.
